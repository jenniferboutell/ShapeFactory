# Git should ignore its own config dir by default, but hey.
.git

# PyCharm IDE. Guidance varies on what to ignore:
# https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24516814/should-i-ignore-the-idea-folder-when-using-pycharm-with-git
#
# PyCharm itself automatically adds a .idea/.gitgnore containing:
# /shelf/
# /workspace.xml
#
# Have also found that when a Python environent is configured locally for the project,
# the path to the local Python interpreter is by default included in the name of that
# environemnt, which will in turn appear in:
# /<projectname>.iml
# /misc.xml
#
# Safest course is to just ignore all of it.
# This may require each user to do local setup, but only one-time hit.
# However... since .idea/ and its contents were included in the initial commit,
# may be too late for subsequent entry in .gitignore to have desired effect.
# Probably wise to also add an entry in .git/info/exclude in local repo.
.idea
