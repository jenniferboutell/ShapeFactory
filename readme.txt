Question for Tom
- Regarding equality: Geometrically it doesn't matter which order the three sides of a triangle are presented or
oriented, in order to be considered equal. Likewise, a rectangle with width 3 and length 2 is identical to
a rectangle with length 3 and width 2. For the purpose of determining equality in this assignment,
is that still the case?
